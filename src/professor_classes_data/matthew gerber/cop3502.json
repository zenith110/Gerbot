At some points passing felt impossible but Gerber is always working in favor of his students with being fairly accessible, extending deadlines, and adjusting the schedule if necessary. A solid choice regardless if you're taking the Foundation Exam or not.",

I never leave reviews but professor Gerber really made sure I learned and helped me overcome any doubt about my ability to perform well in his class. His class is tough but he's always available and gives you many opportunities. He truly cares for his students and is very accommodating.",
